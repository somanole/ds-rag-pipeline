    ">  \n",

    "> 🔍 **Importance of Normalization in FAISS (Cosine Similarity)**  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> If you set `distance_strategy=\"COSINE\"` but do **not** enable `normalize_embeddings=True`,  \n",
    "> FAISS will default to using **unnormalized dot product** — not true cosine similarity.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> **As a result:**  \n",
    "> - Similarity scores may be skewed by vector lengths.  \n",
    "> - Retrieval results can become inconsistent or incorrect.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> ✅ **Solution:**  \n",
    "> Always normalize embeddings (both **chunks** and **queries**) before storing or searching.  \n",
    "> This ensures the dot product reflects **true cosine similarity**,  \n",
    "> where comparison is based purely on **direction**, not **magnitude**.  \n",
