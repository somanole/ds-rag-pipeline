    "> ⚠️ **Note: Why Embedding Normalization Matters in RAG (with FAISS + Cosine Similarity)**  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), accurate retrieval is critical.  \n",
    "> Since most vector search relies on comparing **semantic similarity**,  \n",
    "> we often use **cosine similarity** to find relevant chunks.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> However, cosine similarity compares **direction**, not magnitude.  \n",
    "> If your embeddings are **not normalized**, the similarity score can be biased by vector length — leading to irrelevant results or lower-quality answers.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> 🔍 **Importance of Normalization in FAISS (Cosine Similarity)**  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> If you set `distance_strategy=\"COSINE\"` but do **not** enable `normalize_embeddings=True`,  \n",
    "> FAISS will default to using **unnormalized dot product** — not true cosine similarity.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> **As a result:**  \n",
    "> - Similarity scores may be skewed by vector lengths.  \n",
    "> - Retrieval results can become inconsistent or incorrect.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> ✅ **Solution:**  \n",
    "> Always normalize embeddings (both **chunks** and **queries**) before storing or searching.  \n",
    "> This ensures the dot product reflects **true cosine similarity**,  \n",
    "> where comparison is based purely on **direction**, not **magnitude**.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> ℹ️ Without normalization, FAISS effectively ignores your `COSINE` strategy and uses inner product directly. [source](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/32498)\n"
